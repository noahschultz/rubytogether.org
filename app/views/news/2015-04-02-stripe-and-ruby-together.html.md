<% title "Stripe ❤️ Ruby Together" %>

Today we're pleased to officially announce [Stripe](https://stripe.com), the payments platform for the internet, as a founding corporate member of Ruby Together. Stripe has been a a part of Ruby Together since before it even began, when their CTO Greg Brockman came forward to sponsor development and maintenance work on Bundler. That sponsorship proved that the concept of community-funded infrastructure was feasible, and ultimately led André Arko to found Ruby Together.

Stripe continues to [support Ruby's public infrastructure](<%= root_path(anchor: "join") %>) both now and in the future as a member of Ruby Together, and we're very happy about that.
