<% title "June 2015 Monthly Update" %>

Wow. June was really busy. Right as it was time for us to write the June update, the Bundler 1.10 release turned into a Bundler 1.10 fiasco. We spent dozens of hours talking with users, coming up with workarounds, and trying to help everyone upgrade to the newest version of Bundler as smoothly as possible.

The discussions and workarounds are summarized in the epic [Bundler 1.10 release announcement and retrospective](http://bundler.io/blog/2015/06/24/version-1-10-released.html). We weren't able to complete the regular Ruby Together update due to that emergency work, but we'll have a complete update ready on schedule for July, and it will include details about June as well. See you then!

Until next time,  
Andr√© and the Ruby Together team
