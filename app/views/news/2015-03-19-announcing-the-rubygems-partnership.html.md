<% title "Announcing The Rubygems Partnership" %>

We are pleased to announce that Ruby Together has joined with [Ruby Central](http://rubycentral.org) to create [The Rubygems Partnership](<%= rubygems_path %>), an ongoing project to improve the stability and performance of [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org).

As part of this partnership, Ruby Central will continue to underwrite hosting and operational costs for RubyGems.org, while Ruby Together will fund ongoing maintenance and development work.

In this way, the partnership accomplishes the goals of both Ruby Central and Ruby Together, ensuring that RubyGems.org is funded and stable for the long term, while also providing a way for it to grow and improve without relying on unpaid labor from volunteers.

To support Ruby Together in its work maintaining and developing Ruby's [public infrastructure](<%= roadmap_path %>), [become a member](<%= root_path(anchor: "join") %>) today!
