<% title "Friends of Ruby Together" %>

Since we launched earlier this week, several people have let us know that while they think Ruby Together is a wonderful idea, the current membership dues are more than they can afford. We want everyone to be able to support Ruby Together and the public infrastructure, so we've created another option: [Friends of Ruby Together](<%= friends_path %>).

Friends of Ruby Together includes everyone who contributes to help support our work. While we aren't able to provide member benefits to friends of Ruby Together, every dollar will go directly to support our ongoing work on the public infrastructure of Ruby. Contributions can be as small as just $1. [Become a Friend](<%= friends_path %>) today!
