Ruby Together is immensely pleased to announce that [Cloud City Development](http://cloudcity.io) has become our newest corporate member. Cloud City has employed [André Arko](https://twitter.com/indirect) for years, providing him with time and opportunities to work on open source, speak at conferences, and work on Ruby infrastructure.

Cloud City continues to support work on the open source powering Ruby's infrastructure both indirectly, by providing André with consulting work to ensure his bills are paid, and directly, as a member of Ruby Together.

Join Cloud City in supporting and improving the infrastructure that all Rubyists depend on by [becoming a member](<%= root_path(anchor: "join") %>) of Ruby Together.
