Today, we are pleased to be able to inform everyone that [Engine Yard](https://www.engineyard.com), the original Ruby platform as a service, is a founding corporate member of Ruby Together. As a [sponsor of Bundler](https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/engine-yard-sponsors-bundler) even before Ruby Together existed, as well as a previous sponsor of Rails, Rubinius, and JRuby, Engine Yard has a long history of support for both open source work and public Ruby infrastructure.

Now, Engine Yard supports Bundler, RubyGems.org, and other Ruby infrastructure as a member of Ruby Together. [Become a member](<%= root_path(anchor: "join") %>) alongside Engine Yard, improving things for everyone who uses Ruby.
